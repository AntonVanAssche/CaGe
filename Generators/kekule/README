The program should compile without problems on POSIX conformant
systems.

To build the program, just run make. If you don't have make,
try:
  cc -o fusgen *.c

You may have to change the definition of LONGTYPE in fusgen.h
if your compiler doesn't support the data type 'long long'.

You also may want to change
    CFLAGS = -O
in the Makefile to something like
    CFLAGS = -O3
or similar.
